These boards are usually equipped with relay outputs, optically isolated digital inputs, RS232 serial port, 24VDC input power. Are encased in a convenient plastic, din rail compatible mount enclosure, and screw terminals for input/outputs. This is a collective effort to document pin maps for the most common types of board available on online markets, so they will be usable with different firmware and build tools, like arduino.

## Versions

There are several board versions, each one with different personalities
