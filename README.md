This boards are usually equipped with relay outputs, opticaly isolated digital inputs, RS232 serial port, 24VDC input power. Are enclosed in a convenient plastic din rail compatible mount enclosure, and screw terminals for input/outpus. This is a collective effort to document pinmaps for most common types of board available on online markets, so they will be usable with different firmware and build tools, like arduino.
